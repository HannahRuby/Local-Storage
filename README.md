Web Storage: Local Storage
Overview
Web Browsers provide a number of different ways to store data for a user locally, in the browser. It's called "Web Storage", and the term includes a handful of different approaches to saving local user data. The first, and simplest, is "Local Storage". Local Storage provides a simple API to set and get values, it's a "Key-Value" store, a bit like a JavaScript object, but it persists between page reloads, and browser restarts.

It's often not a good idea to use Local Storage like a full database, and it has limited size of around 5MB, but it's a great way to store small amounts of data such as user preferences for colour schemes and themes.

Saving data to Local Storage
‚õ≥Ô∏è In a new project, create a new HTML file called index.html and add the following code:

<!DOCTYPE html>

<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title>Local Storage</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    <h1>Local Storage</h1>
    <p>My favourite colour is:</p>
    <form>
      <input type="text" name="colour" />
      <button type="submit">Save</button>
    </form>
  </body>
</html>
‚õ≥Ô∏è Create a new file called script.js, select the form, and get the value of the input. Log it to the console to check it's working.

const form = document.querySelector("form");

form.addEventListener("submit", function (event) {
  event.preventDefault();

  const formData = new FormData(form);
  const colour = formData.get("colour");

  localStorage.setItem("colour", colour);
});
 
‚õ≥Ô∏è Enter a colour into the input and click the button.

üëÄ Open the Dev Tools, and go to the Application tab. In the left hand menu, click "Local Storage", and you should see a key called "colour" with the value you entered. Each time you change the value and press the button, the value will update in realtime. Notice how when you refresh the page or close the browser, the value is still there when you visit the page.

üí≠ The storage is associated with the URL, including the port. Values saved on localhost:3000, are not available on localhost:5173.

Retrieving data from Local Storage
‚õ≥Ô∏è In the script.js file, add the following code to retrieve the value from Local Storage and set it as the value of the input:

const colour = localStorage.getItem("colour");

if (colour) {
  const input = document.querySelector("input");
  input.value = colour;
}
 
üëÄ Refresh the page, and the input should populate with your saved value.

JSON
The Local Storage Key/Value store doesn't accept complex objects or functions. It will only accept strings. In order to save a simple object we need to convert it to a string, and then convert it back into an object when we retrieve it.

We can do this using the JSON.stringify and JSON.parse methods.

‚õ≥Ô∏è In the script.js file, change the save an object to Local Storage:

const form = document.querySelector("form");

function savePreferences(event) {
  event.preventDefault();

  const formData = new FormData(form);
  const colour = formData.get("colour");

  // preferences is now an object, it might contain other preferences...
  const preferences = {
    colour,
  };

  // so when we save it, we stringify it
  localStorage.setItem("preferences", JSON.stringify(preferences));
}

form.addEventListener("submit", savePreferences);
 
‚õ≥Ô∏è In the script.js file, add the following code to retrieve the object from Local Storage:

// then we parse the string back into an object when we retrieve it
const preferences = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("preferences"));

if (preferences) {
  const input = document.querySelector("input");
  input.value = preferences.colour;
}
 
üëÄ Refresh the page, and the input should populate with your saved value.

Applying preferences
To apply the preferences we'll need to read the preference values on page load and update the page to reflect them. If we use the colour to represent the text colour, we could apply the colour code to the body of the page.

‚õ≥Ô∏è In the script.js file, add the following code to retrieve the object from Local Storage:

function loadPreferences() {
  // load the prefs
  const preferences = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("preferences"));

  // if we have some prefs
  if (preferences) {
    // set the form value
    const input = document.querySelector("input");
    input.value = preferences.colour || "#000000"; // || is the "or" operator, it will use the value on the left if it's truthy, otherwise it will use the value on the right as a default value if colour isn't saved

    // set the body color to the user colour preference (intentional US / UK spelling difference...)
    const body = document.querySelector("body");
    body.style.color = preferences.colour || "#000000";
  }
}
 
üéØ Add some more user preferences to the page, and action the preferences when the page loads so that your background colour, font size, etc. or whatever features you want can be edit, saved and restored to the user's preferences. Go to town. If you have hosted images you can save URLs in there too!

Clearing Local Storage
In case you need it, you can remove items from local storage with the removeItem method.

function clearPreferences(event) {
  event.preventDefault();

  localStorage.removeItem("preferences");
}
 
üéØ Add a "Reset to defaults" button that resets everything to a set of default values.

const defaults = {
  colour: "#000000",
};

body.style.color = preferences.colour || defaults.colour;
 
Observing Local Storage values changing
It's useful to be aware that you can listen for local storage values changing - there is an event. You can use this to run code when some value is changed in the store - for example, if you're saving a users favourite colour or page theme, you can make sure the page is updated to reflect the preference whenever it changes. This also works across multiple browser tabs - so you can keep them in sync!

// Function to handle changes in local storage
function handleLocalStorageChange(event) {
  if (event.key === "favouriteColour") {
    // Do something when the specific local storage key changes
    const newValue = event.newValue;
    console.log(`Local storage favouriteColour changed to: ${newValue}`);
  }
}

// Add an event listener to listen for changes in local storage
window.addEventListener("storage", handleLocalStorageChange);
